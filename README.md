# WordMint-Trench-Protocol
Intercept and decrypt anomalous deep-sea audio broadcasts in this atmospheric typing survival game.


Welcome to the Trench. 

**WordMint: Trench Protocol** is an atmospheric, audio-based typing game. You are a Signals Intelligence Analyst stationed in an abyssal research submarine. Your mission is to intercept, decipher, and manually log heavily encrypted audio broadcasts originating from an unknown source at the bottom of the ocean.

As you dive deeper, the anomalies grow more complex, and your hull integrity is ticking down. 

### STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE
1. **Listen:** The onboard Sonar AI will dictate an intercepted transmission (make sure your volume is up).
2. **Decrypt:** Type the exact spelling of the word using your terminal.
3. **Survive:** Press ENTER to submit your decryption key before the Submarine's Hull Integrity drops to 0%.

### TERMINAL COMMANDS
If the signal degrades, you can use the following commands in your terminal:
* `/replay` - Prompts the AI to rebroadcast the audio.
* `/hint` - Runs a syllabic audio analysis on the current intercept.
* `/clear` - Wipes the terminal screen.

*Will you uncover the truth buried beneath the surface?*
